1.1.11
 * #26: Add "ssh_command" to configuration for specifying a custom SSH command or options.
 * Fix for incorrect /etc/borgmatic.d/ configuration path probing on macOS. This problem manifested
   as an error on startup: "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/borgmatic.d'".

1.1.10
 * Pass several Unix signals through to child processes like Borg. This means that Borg now properly
   shuts down if borgmatic is terminated (e.g. due to a system suspend).
 * #30: Support for using tilde in repository paths to reference home directory.

 * #34: Improve clarity of logging spew at high verbosity levels.
 * #30: Support for using tilde in source directory path to reference home directory.

 * Update dead links to Borg documentation.

1.1.8
 * #40: Fix to make /etc/borgmatic/config.yaml optional rather than required when using the default

   checking enabled. This supports use cases like running consistency checks from a different cron
   job with a different frequency, or running pruning with a different verbosity level.

1.1.3

 * #15: Support for running multiple config files in /etc/borgmatic.d/ from a single borgmatic run.
 * Fix for generate-borgmatic-config writing config with invalid one_file_system value.

 * Dropped Python 2 support. Now Python 3 only.
 * #19: Fix for README mention of sample files not included in package.
 * #23: Sample files for triggering borgmatic from a systemd timer.

 * #20: Support for Borg's --remote-path option to use an alternate Borg
   executable. See sample/config.

1.0.0

 * Attic is no longer supported, as there hasn't been any recent development on
   it. Dropping Attic support will allow faster iteration on Borg-specific
   features. If you're still using Attic, this is a good time to switch to Borg!
 * Project renamed from atticmatic to borgmatic. See the borgmatic README for
   information on upgrading.

0.1.8

 * Fix for handling of spaces in source_directories which resulted in backup up everything.
 * Fix for broken links to Borg documentation.
 * At verbosity zero, suppressing Borg check stderr spew about "Checking segments".

 * Improved mocking of Python builtins in unit tests.

0.0.6

 * New configuration section for customizing which Attic consistency checks run, if any.

0.0.5

 * Fixed regression with --verbose output being buffered. This means dropping the helpful error
   message introduced in 0.0.4.

0.0.4

 * Now using tox to run tests against multiple versions of Python in one go.
 * Helpful error message about how to create a repository if one is missing.
 * Troubleshooting section with steps to deal with broken pipes.
