 * Show summary log errors regardless of verbosity level, and log the "summary:" header with a log
   level based on the contained summary logs.

1.4.13

   verbosity level.

1.4.12
 * #247: With "borgmatic check", consider Borg warnings as errors.
 * Dial back the display of inline error logs a bit, so failed command output doesn't appear
   multiple times in the logs (well, except for the summary).

1.4.11

   completion and failure pings.

   they occur.

 * #20: Support for Borg's --remote-path option to use an alternate Borg
   executable. See sample/config.

   it. Dropping Attic support will allow faster iteration on Borg-specific
   features. If you're still using Attic, this is a good time to switch to Borg!
 * Project renamed from atticmatic to borgmatic. See the borgmatic README for
   information on upgrading.

0.1.8

 * Fix for handling of spaces in source_directories which resulted in backup up everything.
 * Fix for broken links to Borg documentation.

 * Helpful error message about how to create a repository if one is missing.
 * Troubleshooting section with steps to deal with broken pipes.
