1.1.10.dev0
 * Pass several Unix signals through to child processes like Borg. This means that Borg now properly
   shuts down if borgmatic is terminated (e.g. due to a system suspend).
 * #29: Support for using tilde in repository paths to reference home directory.
 * #42: Support for Borg --files-cache option for setting the files cache operation mode.

1.1.9
 * #16, #38: Support for user-defined hooks before/after backup, or on error.
 * #33: Improve clarity of logging spew at high verbosity levels.
 * #29: Support for using tilde in source directory path to reference home directory.
 * Require "prefix" in retention section when "archive_name_format" is set. This is to avoid
   accidental pruning of archives with a different archive name format. For similar reasons, default
   "prefix" to "{hostname}-" if not specified.
 * Convert main source repository from Mercurial to Git.
 * Update dead links to Borg documentation.

1.1.8
 * #39: Fix to make /etc/borgmatic/config.yaml optional rather than required when using the default
   config paths.

1.1.7

 * #28: Add "archive_name_format" to configuration for customizing archive names.
 * Fix for traceback when "exclude_from" value is empty in configuration file.
 * When pruning, make highest verbosity level list archives kept and pruned.
 * Clarification of Python 3 pip usage in documentation.

1.1.6

 * #12, #35: Support for Borg --exclude-from, --exclude-caches, and --exclude-if-present options.

1.1.5

 * #34: New "extract" consistency check that performs a dry-run extraction of the most recent
   archive.

1.1.4

 * #17: Added command-line flags for performing a borgmatic run with only pruning, creating, or
   checking enabled. This supports use cases like running consistency checks from a different cron
   job with a different frequency, or running pruning with a different verbosity level.

1.1.3

 * #14: Support for running multiple config files in /etc/borgmatic.d/ from a single borgmatic run.
 * Fix for generate-borgmatic-config writing config with invalid one_file_system value.

1.1.2

 * #32: Fix for passing check_last as integer to subprocess when calling Borg.

1.1.1

 * Part of #32: Fix for upgrade-borgmatic-config converting check_last option as a string instead of
   an integer.
 * Fix for upgrade-borgmatic-config erroring when consistency checks option is not present.

1.1.0

 * Switched config file format to YAML. Run upgrade-borgmatic-config to upgrade.
 * Added generate-borgmatic-config command for initial config creation.
 * Dropped Python 2 support. Now Python 3 only.
 * #18: Fix for README mention of sample files not included in package.
 * #22: Sample files for triggering borgmatic from a systemd timer.
 * Support for backing up to multiple repositories.
 * To free up space, now pruning backups prior to creating a new backup.
 * Enabled test coverage output during tox runs.
 * Added logo.

1.0.3

 * #21: Fix for verbosity flag not actually causing verbose output.

1.0.2

 * #20: Fix for traceback when remote_path option is missing.

1.0.1

 * #19: Support for Borg's --remote-path option to use an alternate Borg
   executable. See sample/config.

1.0.0

 * Attic is no longer supported, as there hasn't been any recent development on
   it. Dropping Attic support will allow faster iteration on Borg-specific
   features. If you're still using Attic, this is a good time to switch to Borg!
 * Project renamed from atticmatic to borgmatic. See the borgmatic README for
   information on upgrading.

0.1.8

 * Fix for handling of spaces in source_directories which resulted in backup up everything.
 * Fix for broken links to Borg documentation.
 * At verbosity zero, suppressing Borg check stderr spew about "Checking segments".
 * Support for Borg --one-file-system.
 * Support for Borg create --umask.
 * Support for file globs in source_directories.

0.1.7

 * #11: Fixed parsing of punctuation in configuration file.
 * Better error message when configuration file is missing.

0.1.6

 * #9: New configuration option for the encryption passphrase.
 * #10: Support for Borg's new archive compression feature.

0.1.5

 * Changes to support release on PyPI. Now pip installable by name!

0.1.4

 * Adding test that setup.py version matches release version.

0.1.3

 * #1: Add support for "borg check --last N" to Borg backend.

0.1.2

 * As a convenience to new users, allow a missing default excludes file.
 * New issue tracker, linked from documentation.

0.1.1

 * Adding borgmatic cron example, and updating documentation to refer to it.

0.1.0

 * New "borgmatic" command to support Borg backup software, a fork of Attic.

0.0.7

 * Flag for multiple levels of verbosity: some, and lots.
 * Improved mocking of Python builtins in unit tests.

0.0.6

 * New configuration section for customizing which Attic consistency checks run, if any.

0.0.5

 * Fixed regression with --verbose output being buffered. This means dropping the helpful error
   message introduced in 0.0.4.

0.0.4

 * Now using tox to run tests against multiple versions of Python in one go.
 * Helpful error message about how to create a repository if one is missing.
 * Troubleshooting section with steps to deal with broken pipes.
 * Nosetests config file (setup.cfg) with defaults.

0.0.3

 * After pruning, run attic's consistency checks on all archives.
 * Integration tests for argument parsing.
 * Documentation updates about repository encryption.

0.0.2

 * Configuration support for additional attic prune flags: keep_within, keep_hourly, keep_yearly,
   and prefix.

0.0.1

 * Initial release.
