   it. Dropping Attic support will allow faster iteration on Borg-specific
   features. If you're still using Attic, this is a good time to switch to Borg!
 * Project renamed from atticmatic to borgmatic. See the borgmatic README for
   information on upgrading.

0.1.8

 * Fix for handling of spaces in source_directories which resulted in backup up everything.
 * Fix for broken links to Borg documentation.

 * Improved mocking of Python builtins in unit tests.

   message introduced in 0.0.4.

0.0.4

 * Now using tox to run tests against multiple versions of Python in one go.
 * Helpful error message about how to create a repository if one is missing.
 * Troubleshooting section with steps to deal with broken pipes.
