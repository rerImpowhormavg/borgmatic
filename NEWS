 * Add support for Python 3.9.
 * Update versions of test dependencies (test_requirements.txt and test containers).
 * Only support black code formatter on Python 3.8+. New black dependencies make installation
   difficult on older versions of Python.
 * Replace "improve this documentation" form with link to support and ticket tracker.

1.5.12
 * Fix for previous release with incorrect version suffix in setup.py. No other changes.

   on different filesystems were related by parentage (e.g. "/foo" and "/foo/bar/baz") and the
   one_file_system option was enabled.
 * Update documentation code fragments theme to better match the rest of the page.
 * Improve configuration reference documentation readability via more aggressive word-wrapping in
   configuration schema descriptions.

1.5.6
 * #292: Allow before_backup and similiar hooks to exit with a soft failure without altering the

 * #315: Fix enabled database hooks to implicitly set one_file_system configuration option to true.
   This prevents Borg from reading devices like /dev/zero and hanging.
 * #316: Fix hang when streaming a database dump to Borg with implicit duplicate source directories
   by deduplicating them first.
 * #319: Fix error message when there are no MySQL databases to dump for "all" databases.

1.5.4
 * #310: Fix legitimate database dump command errors (exit code 1) not being treated as errors by
   borgmatic.
 * For database dumps, replace the named pipe on every borgmatic run. This prevent hangs on stale
   pipes left over from previous runs.
 * Fix error handling to handle more edge cases when executing commands.

1.5.3
 * #258: Stream database dumps and restores directly to/from Borg without using any additional
   filesystem space. This feature is automatic, and works even on restores from archives made with
   previous versions of borgmatic.
 * #293: Documentation on macOS launchd permissions issues with work-around for Full Disk Access.
 * Remove "borgmatic restore --progress" flag, as it now conflicts with streaming database restores.

1.5.2
 * #301: Fix MySQL restore error on "all" database dump by excluding system tables.
 * Fix PostgreSQL restore error on "all" database dump by using "psql" for the restore instead of
   "pg_restore".

1.5.1

   actions? Me too. Now you can specify "--archive latest" to all actions that accept an archive
   flag.
 * #290: Fix the "--stats" and "--files" flags so that they yield output at verbosity 0.
 * Reduce the default verbosity of borgmatic logs sent to Healthchecks monitoring hook. Now, it's
   warnings and errors only. You can increase the verbosity via the "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * Add security policy documentation in SECURITY.md.

1.5.0
 * #245: Monitor backups with PagerDuty hook integration. See the documentation for more
   information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#pagerduty-hook

 * #274: Add ~/.config/borgmatic.d as another configuration directory default.
 * #277: Customize Healthchecks log level via borgmatic "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * #280: Change "exclude_if_present" option to support multiple filenames that indicate a directory
   should be excluded from backups, rather than just a single filename.
 * #284: Backup to a removable drive or intermittent server via "soft failure" feature. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-to-a-removable-drive-or-an-intermittent-server/
 * #287: View consistency check progress via "--progress" flag for "check" action.
 * For "create" and "prune" actions, no longer list files or show detailed stats at any verbosities
   by default. You can opt back in with "--files" or "--stats" flags.
 * For "list" and "info" actions, show repository names even at verbosity 0.

1.4.22
 * #276, #285: Disable colored output when "--json" flag is used, so as to produce valid JSON ouput.

   the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#configuration-overrides
 * #270: Only trigger "on_error" hooks and monitoring failures for "prune", "create", and "check"
   actions, and not for other actions.
 * When pruning with verbosity level 1, list pruned and kept archives. Previously, this information
   was only shown at verbosity level 2.

1.4.20
 * Fix repository probing during "borgmatic init" to respect verbosity flag and remote_path option.
 * #249: Update Healthchecks/Cronitor/Cronhub monitoring integrations to fire for "check" and
   "prune" actions, not just "create".

1.4.19
 * #259: Optionally change the internal database dump path via "borgmatic_source_directory" option

   borgmatic does not yet support natively. Use "extra_borg_options" in the storage configuration
   section.
 * #266: Attempt to repair any inconsistencies found during a consistency check via
   "borgmatic check --repair" flag.

1.4.16
 * #256: Fix for "before_backup" hook not triggering an error when the command contains "borg" and

 * Fix for database dump removal incorrectly skipping some database dumps.
 * #123: Support for mounting an archive as a FUSE filesystem via "borgmatic mount" action, and
   unmounting via "borgmatic umount". See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/extract-a-backup/#mount-a-filesystem

1.4.14
 * Show summary log errors regardless of verbosity level, and log the "summary:" header with a log
   level based on the contained summary logs.

1.4.13
 * Show full error logs at "--verbosity 0" so you can see command output without upping the
   verbosity level.

1.4.12
 * #247: With "borgmatic check", consider Borg warnings as errors.
 * Dial back the display of inline error logs a bit, so failed command output doesn't appear
   multiple times in the logs (well, except for the summary).

1.4.11
 * #241: When using the Healthchecks monitoring hook, include borgmatic logs in the payloads for
   completion and failure pings.
 * With --verbosity level 1 or 2, show error logs both inline when they occur and in the summary
   logs at the bottom. With lower verbosity levels, suppress the summary and show error logs when
   they occur.

1.4.10
 * #246: Fix for "borgmatic restore" showing success and incorrectly extracting archive files, even
   when no databases are configured to restore. As this can overwrite files from the archive and
   lead to data loss, please upgrade to get the fix before using "borgmatic restore".
 * Reopen the file given by "--log-file" flag if an external program rotates the log file while
   borgmatic is running.

 * #54: Fix for incorrect consistency check flags passed to Borg when all three checks ("repository",
   "archives", and "extract") are specified in borgmatic configuration.
 * #48: Add "local_path" to configuration for specifying an alternative Borg executable path.
 * #49: Support for Borg experimental --patterns-from and --patterns options for specifying mixed
   includes/excludes.
 * Moved issue tracker from Taiga to integrated Gitea tracker at
   https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic/issues

1.1.12
 * #46: Declare dependency on pykwalify 1.6 or above, as older versions yield "Unknown key: version"
   rule errors.
 * Support for Borg --keep-minutely prune option.

1.1.11
 * #26: Add "ssh_command" to configuration for specifying a custom SSH command or options.
 * Fix for incorrect /etc/borgmatic.d/ configuration path probing on macOS. This problem manifested
   as an error on startup: "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/borgmatic.d'".

1.1.10
 * Pass several Unix signals through to child processes like Borg. This means that Borg now properly
   shuts down if borgmatic is terminated (e.g. due to a system suspend).
 * #30: Support for using tilde in repository paths to reference home directory.
 * #43: Support for Borg --files-cache option for setting the files cache operation mode.
 * #45: Support for Borg --remote-ratelimit option for limiting upload rate.
 * Log invoked Borg commands when at highest verbosity level.

1.1.9
 * #17, #39: Support for user-defined hooks before/after backup, or on error.
 * #34: Improve clarity of logging spew at high verbosity levels.
 * #30: Support for using tilde in source directory path to reference home directory.
 * Require "prefix" in retention section when "archive_name_format" is set. This is to avoid
   accidental pruning of archives with a different archive name format. For similar reasons, default
   "prefix" to "{hostname}-" if not specified.
 * Convert main source repository from Mercurial to Git.
 * Update dead links to Borg documentation.

1.1.8
 * #40: Fix to make /etc/borgmatic/config.yaml optional rather than required when using the default
   config paths.

1.1.7

 * #29: Add "archive_name_format" to configuration for customizing archive names.
 * Fix for traceback when "exclude_from" value is empty in configuration file.
 * When pruning, make highest verbosity level list archives kept and pruned.
 * Clarification of Python 3 pip usage in documentation.

1.1.6

 * #13, #36: Support for Borg --exclude-from, --exclude-caches, and --exclude-if-present options.

1.1.5

 * #35: New "extract" consistency check that performs a dry-run extraction of the most recent
   archive.

1.1.4

 * #18: Added command-line flags for performing a borgmatic run with only pruning, creating, or
   checking enabled. This supports use cases like running consistency checks from a different cron
   job with a different frequency, or running pruning with a different verbosity level.

1.1.3

 * #15: Support for running multiple config files in /etc/borgmatic.d/ from a single borgmatic run.
 * Fix for generate-borgmatic-config writing config with invalid one_file_system value.

1.1.2

 * #33: Fix for passing check_last as integer to subprocess when calling Borg.

1.1.1

 * Part of #33: Fix for upgrade-borgmatic-config converting check_last option as a string instead of
   an integer.
 * Fix for upgrade-borgmatic-config erroring when consistency checks option is not present.

1.1.0

 * Switched config file format to YAML. Run upgrade-borgmatic-config to upgrade.
 * Added generate-borgmatic-config command for initial config creation.
 * Dropped Python 2 support. Now Python 3 only.
 * #19: Fix for README mention of sample files not included in package.
 * #23: Sample files for triggering borgmatic from a systemd timer.
 * Support for backing up to multiple repositories.
 * To free up space, now pruning backups prior to creating a new backup.
 * Enabled test coverage output during tox runs.
 * Added logo.

1.0.3

 * #22: Fix for verbosity flag not actually causing verbose output.

1.0.2

 * #21: Fix for traceback when remote_path option is missing.

1.0.1

 * #20: Support for Borg's --remote-path option to use an alternate Borg
   executable. See sample/config.

1.0.0

 * Attic is no longer supported, as there hasn't been any recent development on
   it. Dropping Attic support will allow faster iteration on Borg-specific
   features. If you're still using Attic, this is a good time to switch to Borg!
 * Project renamed from atticmatic to borgmatic. See the borgmatic README for
   information on upgrading.

0.1.8

 * Fix for handling of spaces in source_directories which resulted in backup up everything.
 * Fix for broken links to Borg documentation.
 * At verbosity zero, suppressing Borg check stderr spew about "Checking segments".
 * Support for Borg --one-file-system.
 * Support for Borg create --umask.
 * Support for file globs in source_directories.

0.1.7

 * #12: Fixed parsing of punctuation in configuration file.
 * Better error message when configuration file is missing.

0.1.6

 * #10: New configuration option for the encryption passphrase.
 * #11: Support for Borg's new archive compression feature.

 * New "borgmatic" command to support Borg backup software, a fork of Attic.

0.0.7

 * Flag for multiple levels of verbosity: some, and lots.
 * Improved mocking of Python builtins in unit tests.

0.0.6

 * New configuration section for customizing which Attic consistency checks run, if any.

0.0.5

 * Fixed regression with --verbose output being buffered. This means dropping the helpful error
   message introduced in 0.0.4.

0.0.4

 * Now using tox to run tests against multiple versions of Python in one go.
 * Helpful error message about how to create a repository if one is missing.
 * Troubleshooting section with steps to deal with broken pipes.
 * Nosetests config file (setup.cfg) with defaults.

0.0.3

 * After pruning, run attic's consistency checks on all archives.
 * Integration tests for argument parsing.
