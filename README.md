## Overview

borgmatic is simple, configuration-driven backup software for servers and
workstations. Backup all of your machines from the command-line or scheduled
jobs. No GUI required. Built atop [Borg Backup](https://www.borgbackup.org/),
borgmatic initiates a backup, prunes any old backups according to a retention
policy, and validates backups for consistency. borgmatic supports specifying
your settings in a declarative configuration file, rather than having to put
them all on the command-line, and handles common errors.

Here's an example config file:

```yaml
location:
    # List of source directories to backup. Globs are expanded.
    source_directories:
        - /home
        - /etc
        - /var/log/syslog*

    # Paths to local or remote repositories.
    repositories:
        - user@backupserver:sourcehostname.borg

    # Any paths matching these patterns are excluded from backups.
    exclude_patterns:
        - /home/*/.cache

retention:
    # Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category.
    keep_daily: 7
    keep_weekly: 4
    keep_monthly: 6

consistency:
    # List of consistency checks to run: "repository", "archives", or both.
    checks:
        - repository
        - archives
```

borgmatic is hosted at <https://torsion.org/borgmatic> with [source code
available](https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic). It's also mirrored
on [GitHub](https://github.com/witten/borgmatic) for convenience.
