## It's your data. Keep it that way.

borgmatic is simple, configuration-driven backup software for servers and
workstations. Protect your files with client-side encryption. Backup your
databases too. Monitor it all with integrated third-party services.

Here's an example configuration file:

```yaml
location:
    # List of source directories to backup.
    source_directories:
        - /home
        - /etc

    # Paths of local or remote repositories to backup to.
    repositories:
        - 1234@usw-s001.rsync.net:backups.borg
        - k8pDxu32@k8pDxu32.repo.borgbase.com:repo
        - /var/lib/backups/local.borg

retention:
    # Retention policy for how many backups to keep.
    keep_daily: 7
    keep_weekly: 4
    keep_monthly: 6

consistency:
    # List of checks to run to validate your backups.
    checks:
        - repository
        - archives

hooks:
    # Custom preparation scripts to run.
    before_backup:
        - prepare-for-backup.sh

    # Databases to dump and include in backups.
    postgresql_databases:
        - name: users

    # Third-party services to notify you if backups aren't happening.

```
