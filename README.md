## Overview

<img src="https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic/raw/branch/master/static/borgmatic.png" width="150px" style="float: right; padding-left: 1em;">

borgmatic is a simple Python wrapper script for the
[Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/) backup software that initiates a backup,
prunes any old backups according to a retention policy, and validates backups
for consistency. The script supports specifying your settings in a declarative
configuration file rather than having to put them all on the command-line, and
handles common errors.

Here's an example config file:

```yaml
location:
    # List of source directories to backup. Globs are expanded.
    source_directories:
        - /home
        - /etc
        - /var/log/syslog*

    # Paths to local or remote repositories.
    repositories:
        - user@backupserver:sourcehostname.borg

    # Any paths matching these patterns are excluded from backups.
    exclude_patterns:
        - /home/*/.cache

retention:
    # Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category.
    keep_daily: 7
    keep_weekly: 4
    keep_monthly: 6

consistency:
    # List of consistency checks to run: "repository", "archives", or both.
    checks:
        - repository
        - archives
```

borgmatic is hosted at <https://torsion.org/borgmatic> with [source code
available](https://projects.torsion.org/witten/borgmatic). It's also mirrored
on [GitHub](https://github.com/witten/borgmatic) for convenience.
