# This script installs test dependencies and runs all tests, including end-to-end tests. It
# is designed to run inside a test container, and presumes that other test infrastructure like
# databases are already running. Therefore, on a developer machine, you should not run this script
# directly. Instead, run scripts/run-full-dev-tests
