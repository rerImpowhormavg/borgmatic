Overview
--------

atticmatic is a simple Python wrapper script for the Attic backup software
that initiates a backup and prunes any old backups according to a retention
policy. The script supports specifying your settings in a declarative
configuration file rather than having to put them all on the command-line, and
handles common errors.

atticmatic is hosted at http://torsion.org/hg/atticmatic/ and is mirrored on
GitHub and BitBucket for convenience.


Setup
-----

To get up and running with Attic, follow the Attic Quick Start guide at
https://attic-backup.org/quickstart.html to create an Attic repository on a
local or remote host.

If the repository is on a remote host, make sure that your local root user has
key-based ssh access to the desired user account on the remote host.

To install atticmatic, run the following from the directory containing this
README:

    python setup.py install

Then copy the following configuration files:

    sudo cp sample/atticmatic.cron /etc/init.d/atticmatic
    sudo cp sample/config sample/excludes /etc/atticmatic/

Lastly, modify those files with your desired configuration.


Usage
-----

You can run atticmatic and start a backup simply by invoking it without
arguments:

    atticmatic

To get additional information about the progress of the backup, use the
verbose option:

    atticmattic --verbose

If you'd like to see the available command-line arguments, view the help:

    atticmattic --help
