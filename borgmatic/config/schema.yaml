                    List of source directories to backup (required). Globs and
                    tildes are expanded.
                example:
                    - /home
                    - /etc
                    - /var/log/syslog*

                    Paths to local or remote repositories (required). Tildes are
                    expanded. Multiple repositories are backed up to in
                    sequence. Borg placeholders can be used. See the output of
                    "borg help placeholders" for details. See ssh_command for
                    SSH options like identity file or port. If systemd service
                    is used, then add local repository paths in the systemd
                    service file to the ReadWritePaths list.
                example:
                    - user@backupserver:sourcehostname.borg
                    - "user@backupserver:{fqdn}"
            one_file_system:

                desc: |
                    Stay in same file system (do not cross mount points).
                    Defaults to false. But when a database hook is used, the
                    setting here is ignored and one_file_system is considered
                    true.
                example: true
            numeric_owner:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Only store/extract numeric user and group identifiers.
                    Defaults to false.
                example: true
            atime:
                type: bool
                desc: Store atime into archive. Defaults to true.
                example: false
            ctime:
                type: bool
                desc: Store ctime into archive. Defaults to true.
                example: false
            birthtime:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Store birthtime (creation date) into archive. Defaults to
                    true.
                example: false
            read_special:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Use Borg's --read-special flag to allow backup of block and
                    other special devices. Use with caution, as it will lead to
                    problems if used when backing up special devices such as
                    /dev/zero. Defaults to false. But when a database hook is
                    used, the setting here is ignored and read_special is
                    considered true.
                example: false
            bsd_flags:
                type: bool
                desc: |

                    http://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/create.html
                    for details. Defaults to "ctime,size,inode".
                example: ctime,size,inode
            local_path:
                type: str

                    Any paths matching these patterns are included/excluded from
                    backups. Globs are expanded. (Tildes are not.) Note that
                    Borg considers this option experimental. See the output of
                    "borg help patterns" for more details. Quote any value if it
                    contains leading punctuation, so it parses correctly.

                    Read include/exclude patterns from one or more separate
                    named files, one pattern per line. Note that Borg considers
                    this option experimental. See the output of "borg help
                    patterns" for more details.
                example:

                desc: |
                    Any paths matching these patterns are excluded from backups.
                    Globs and tildes are expanded. See the output of "borg help
                    patterns" for more details.
                example:

                    - /home/*/.cache
                    - /etc/ssl
            exclude_from:
                seq:
                    - type: str
                desc: |
                    Read exclude patterns from one or more separate named files,
                    one pattern per line. See the output of "borg help patterns"
                    for more details.
                example:

            exclude_caches:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Exclude directories that contain a CACHEDIR.TAG file. See
                    http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/spec.html for details.
                    Defaults to false.
                example: true
            exclude_if_present:
                seq:
                    - type: str
                desc: |
                    Exclude directories that contain a file with the given
                    filenames. Defaults to not set.
                example:
                    - .nobackup
            keep_exclude_tags:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    If true, the exclude_if_present filename is included in
                    backups. Defaults to false, meaning that the
                    exclude_if_present filename is omitted from backups.
                example: true
            exclude_nodump:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Exclude files with the NODUMP flag. Defaults to false.

                    Path for additional source files used for temporary internal
                    state like borgmatic database dumps. Note that changing this
                    path prevents "borgmatic restore" from finding any database
                    dumps created before the change. Defaults to ~/.borgmatic
                example: /tmp/borgmatic

                desc: |
                    The standard output of this command is used to unlock the
                    encryption key. Only use on repositories that were
                    initialized with passcommand/repokey encryption. Note that
                    if both encryption_passcommand and encryption_passphrase are
                    set, then encryption_passphrase takes precedence. Defaults
                    to not set.
                example: "secret-tool lookup borg-repository repo-name"
            encryption_passphrase:

                desc: |
                    Passphrase to unlock the encryption key with. Only use on
                    repositories that were initialized with passphrase/repokey
                    encryption. Quote the value if it contains punctuation, so
                    it parses correctly. And backslash any quote or backslash
                    literals as well. Defaults to not set.

                    option, you must also specify a prefix in the retention
                    section to avoid accidental pruning of archives with a
                    different archive name format. And you should also specify a

                    Additional options to pass directly to particular Borg
                    commands, handy for Borg options that borgmatic does not yet
                    support natively. Note that borgmatic does not perform any
                    validation on these options. Running borgmatic with
                    "--verbosity 2" shows the exact Borg command-line
                    invocation.
    retention:
        desc: |
            Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category. See
            https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html for
            details. At least one of the "keep" options is required for pruning
            to work. To skip pruning entirely, run "borgmatic create" or "check"
            without the "prune" action. See borgmatic documentation for details.

                    "repository" and "archives". Set to "disabled" to disable
                    all consistency checks. "repository" checks the consistency
                    of the repository, "archives" checks all of the archives,
                    "data" verifies the integrity of the data within the
                    archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run of the
                    most recent archive. Note that "data" implies "archives".

                    Paths to a subset of the repositories in the location
                    section on which to run consistency checks. Handy in case
                    some of your repositories are very large, and so running
                    consistency checks on them would take too long. Defaults to
                    running consistency checks on all repositories configured in
                    the location section.

                    When performing the "archives" check, only consider archive
                    names starting with this prefix. Borg placeholders can be
                    used. See the output of "borg help placeholders" for

                                You probably want to specify the "postgres"
                                superuser here when the database name is "all".
                            example: dbuser

                                Omitting a password will only work if PostgreSQL
                                is configured to trust the configured username
                                without a password, or you create a ~/.pgpass

                    List of one or more PostgreSQL databases to dump before
                    creating a backup, run once per configuration file. The
                    database dumps are added to your source directories at
                    runtime, backed up, and removed afterwards. Requires
                    pg_dump/pg_dumpall/pg_restore commands. See

                                Database name (required if using this hook). Or
                                "all" to dump all databases on the host. Note
                                that using this database hook implicitly enables
                                both read_special and one_file_system (see
                                above) to support dump and restore streaming.
