                                Defaults to the username of the current user.
                                You probably want to specify the "postgres"
                                superuser here when the database name is "all".

                                Omitting a password will only work if PostgreSQL
                                is configured to trust the configured username
                                without a password or you create a ~/.pgpass
                                file.
