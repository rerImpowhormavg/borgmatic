## Supported versions

While we want to hear about security vulnerabilities in all versions of
borgmatic, security fixes are only made to the most recently released version.
It's simply not practical for our small volunteer effort to maintain multiple
release branches and put out separate security patches for each.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please [file a
ticket](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/#issues) or [send email
directly](mailto:witten@torsion.org) as appropriate. You should expect to hear
back within a few days at most and generally sooner.
